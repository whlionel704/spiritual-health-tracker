To create a new service using CLI:
kubectl create svc clusterip mysql-service --tcp=3306:3306 -n database --clusterip=None
headless service -> a service without a clusterIP

Endpoints:
- used to route external service to pods
- e.g. 10.242.1.111
- limitation: only up to 1000 endpoints -> not good for larger cluster -> endpoint slices used instead

endpoint slices -> can distribute the loads to more pods as each endpoint is broken down into slices
