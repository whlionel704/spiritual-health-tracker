ðŸ§± What to Add / Practice:
1. Ingress Controller
    Add an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller or Traefik) to expose your app externally instead of port-forwarding.

    Add HTTPS with TLS (self-signed or via Let's Encrypt using cert-manager).

2. Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)
    Ensure PostgreSQL uses a PersistentVolumeClaim instead of emptyDir for data durability.

    Explore StorageClasses (e.g., hostPath for local dev or dynamic provisioning on cloud).

3. Helm Charts
    Package your Spring Boot app and Postgres resources as Helm Charts.

    Learn about Helm templating, values.yaml overrides, and chart dependencies.

4. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
    Add CPU/Memory resource requests/limits to Spring Boot Deployment.

    Set up HPA for your app using metrics-server.

5. Liveness and Readiness Probes
    Define and test liveness and readiness probes for your Spring Boot container.

    Understand the effect of these on rolling updates and traffic routing.

6. ConfigMaps and Secrets
    Move app config (like DB URLs) to ConfigMaps.

    Use Secrets for passwords (e.g., PostgreSQL credentials).

7. Network Policies
    Define NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic (e.g., only allow app to talk to DB, nothing else).

8. Service Mesh (optional but valuable)
    Add a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd.

    Use it for:

    Traffic shifting / canary releases.

    Mutual TLS between services.

    Observability: metrics, distributed tracing, dashboards.

9. Observability
    Add Prometheus + Grafana stack via Helm for metrics.

    Integrate Spring Boot Actuator metrics with Prometheus.

    Add ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK (Fluentd) stack for logs.

10. CI/CD Deployment to Kubernetes
    Extend your GitHub Actions workflow to:

    Build Docker images.

    Push to DockerHub or GitHub Container Registry.

    Deploy to your Kubernetes cluster (using kubectl or Helm).
